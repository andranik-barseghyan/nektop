                Privacy
                Statement below.</h6>

            <h6>By accepting the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you agree to be bound by the terms and
                conditions of
                the
                Privacy Statement.</h6>

            <h6>1.2 Password Security. You are responsible to keep your password(s) secure, and you agree not to disclose
                your
                passwords to any third party. You are solely responsible for any activity that occurs under your user
                names
                and
                accounts, including any sub-accounts. Academy of Development may request temporary use of your password(s),

                routine
                support
                and maintenance services. If you lose your password(s) or the encryption keys for any of your products

                notify the Academy of Development immediately of any suspected unauthorized use of your accounts or any
                other
                security breach related to the Services. If Academy of Development determines that a security breach or
                suspected
                fraudulent activity has occurred or is likely to occur on your account, Academy of Development may suspend
                your

                necessary to

                being
                confidential, or which is otherwise disclosed in such a manner or is of such a character as would put a

                governmental

                cooperate
                with Academy of Development to obtain a proper protective order, a court ruling quashing any such subpoena,
                or any
                other governmental or private mechanism for retention of the confidential status of the information
